# watermark

This Kotlin program, organized within the "watermark" package, serves the purpose of watermarking images using C++. The program begins with a class definition for "Image," storing details and characteristics of image files, including dimensions, components, and transparency. In the main function, it reads the original and watermark image files, validates their properties, handles watermark alpha channels, and interacts with the user to determine transparency percentage and watermark position. The program offers two position methods: "single" and "grid." It uses a write method function to blend the watermark with the original image, considering transparency, alpha channels, and user-defined parameters. Error handling functions ensure that input data adheres to acceptable standards. Overall, this program provides a versatile command-line tool for image watermarking tasks, allowing users to customize watermark placement and transparency.
